# AtomFigure

AtomFigure is a free app for atom representation. It is compatible with the 18 first atoms (Hydrogen-Argon).
It is still undergoing heavy devellopement and it's features are basic for now. I will try to update it once a month at least.

To get atomFigure, install the zip in the "AtomFigure" folder, and execute the jar in it. It's a runnable jar

IMPORTANT: keep the .pngs!
